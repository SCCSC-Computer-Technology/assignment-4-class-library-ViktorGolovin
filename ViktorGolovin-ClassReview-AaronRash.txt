Viktor Golovin class library code review by Aaron Rash

You went in a bit of a different direction than other students, which piqued my interest.
Most of the assignments I looked at either set data or held queries,
while yours allows you to display a couple different error messages.

I hadn't thought to use a class in this fashion but I dig it.
I was so tunnel visioned on using the class for the main portion of the assignment,
that I never considered to use it to simplify the smaller details.

I tend to use pretty much the same exact error messages in a lot of my projects,
so I can envision expanding a class library like this to streamline a bunch of other small or repetetive tasks.
It would save me from a bunch of busywork

Now that sounds like something I would consider putting in every one of my projects by default.
	which would be the point of a class library I suppose.

In that regard, I think you're on track to make something really useful.
My only reccomendation is to make more. Keep this project around, add new ideas throughout the semester,
see if you can make a comprehensive time saving library.
