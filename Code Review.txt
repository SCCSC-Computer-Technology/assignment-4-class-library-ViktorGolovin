I did not have any problem getting the solution to load up and view the code.
It is definitely set up as a class library.
I only saw three methods inside, each displaying a different error message.
I am not entirely sure, but I thought the intent was to translate our class that we used, outside of our main program into a class library.
The one for handling queries and what not.
I am still a bit unsure about the instructions though and I have already seen a few other uploads set up like you have it.
